Describe the purpose of the async keyword in C# and identify the correct usage scenarios.

Options:
a. async is used to declare that a method contains control flow that involves awaiting asynchronous operations; it allows the method to be paused and resumed without blocking the calling thread;
b. The async keyword is a directive to the compiler to optimize the method for performance regardless of any asynchronous operations;
c. Use of async marks a method to run synchronously but instructs the compiler to use a separate thread to avoid performance hits to the main application thread;
d. async is used exclusively for methods that perform CPU-bound operations to improve computational speed by automatically distributing the work across multiple threads.

In a database or spreadsheet, this might be represented in a single cell under a column named "Options".
